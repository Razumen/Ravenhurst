Here I begin my quest. With the retreating guards closing the road behind me, there is now no turning back. I must reach the gates to the city of Ravenhurst, however I fear that it will still be a long and dangerous trek. 
It looks like I'm going to have to find my way through this cave If i want to make my way back to the road. At least I was fortunate to find some torches...
This must be the General of RavenHurst's guard tower, from the sounds I hear it seems I will have to fight my way down...
I have just arrived in the Constable's underground barracks, surely this place must have been safe, yet, I hear the distant growls of monsters. I must find a way to the city from here...
Finally, the exit from this tower. I'll have to find the switch to open the gate.
I need to find something with which I can pry the switch loose.
